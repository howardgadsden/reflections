How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can review mistakes. You can also copy selections from old versions for projects you are working on.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The risk with manual commits is that you might not do it often enough. The problem with automatic commits is that you might not have a working version of the program when a commit occurs and also you don't have a comment describing the changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is designed to handling coding. In programming there are often closely related files. Google Docs is designed to handle documents. Normally a document stands on its own.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log lists all the versions of a file. Git diff lets you compare two versions of a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert back to a previous version. Also, it is easy to compare versions and identify changes.
