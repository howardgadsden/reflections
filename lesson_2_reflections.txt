What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created.
So git can kepp metadata about the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area. You can still make changes before the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git status and git diff to check to see what changes are in the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help if you want to keep a master working version of your file while trying out changes in another branch. Each branch has a label and can be checked out separately.
